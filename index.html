        <h1>High-Achiever Balance Challenge</h1>
        <div class="intro">
            <p>Welcome to the High-Achiever Balance Challenge! As a busy entrepreneur or high-performer, you are constantly juggling three critical areas of life:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Business Score:</strong> Represents your level of professional success, growth, and productivity. High business scores mean strong performance, but excessive focus may come at a cost to other areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Care Score:</strong> Reflects your physical, mental, and emotional well-being. A high score means you are prioritizing rest, exercise, and personal well-being, preventing burnout.</li>
                <li><strong>Relationships Score:</strong> Measures the quality of your personal and professional relationships. Strong connections provide emotional support, reduce stress, and increase overall happiness.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You'll start with 24 hours, 100 energy points, and equal scores in business, self-care, and relationships. Each decision you make will impact these areas. Your goal is to navigate challenges in a way that fosters success <em>without sacrificing your well-being or personal connections.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="stats">
            <p><strong>Hours Left:</strong> <span id="hours">24</span></p>
            <p><strong>Energy Points:</strong> <span id="energy">100</span></p>
            <p><strong>Business Score:</strong> <span id="business">5</span></p>
            <p><strong>Self-Care Score:</strong> <span id="selfcare">5</span></p>

            <h2>Congratulations! You've Completed the Challenge!</h2>
            <p>Finding the right balance between <strong>Business, Self-Care, and Relationships</strong> is an ongoing journey. Your final scores provide insight into how you naturally prioritize these areas—helping you reflect on what’s working and where adjustments may be needed.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Takeaways & Practical Strategies:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Did work take over?</strong> If your Business Score is high but your Self-Care or Relationships suffered, it may be time to set firmer boundaries. Try using time-blocking to dedicate specific hours for deep work, self-care, and personal connections.</li>
                <li><strong>Are you running on empty?</strong> If your Energy Score dropped significantly, consider prioritizing recovery habits like quality sleep, short breaks during work, and intentional downtime. Research shows that strategic rest improves focus, productivity, and long-term success.</li>
                <li><strong>Did your relationships thrive?</strong> If not, schedule non-negotiable personal time just as you would an important business meeting. Strong relationships fuel resilience, reduce stress, and enhance decision-making.</li>
                <li><strong>How effectively are you managing time?</strong> Many high achievers fall into the "always busy" trap instead of focusing on the highest-impact activities. Review your commitments and ask: Does this align with my goals and values? If not, it may be time to delegate or eliminate it.</li>
                <li><strong>Are you building a sustainable system?</strong> True success isn’t about short-term wins—it’s about creating habits that sustain performance without burnout. Identify one small habit change you can commit to this week that will improve your balance.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Success isn’t just about doing more—it’s about doing what matters.</strong> When you align your <strong>business goals, personal well-being, and meaningful connections</strong>, you build a foundation for lasting fulfillment.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Now, reflect:</strong> What will you start doing differently today?</p>
            
            <h2>More on Your Energy Score</h2>
            <p><strong>Energy Score:</strong> Represents your overall <strong>mental, emotional, and physical stamina</strong> throughout the day. Every decision you make either <strong>drains or replenishes</strong> energy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A high energy score (above 70)</strong> means you are maintaining strong focus, resilience, and endurance throughout your workday.</li>
                <li><strong>A moderate energy score (40-70)</strong> suggests you are managing well but may be approaching burnout if energy isn’t restored.</li>
                <li><strong>A low energy score (below 40)</strong> indicates you are depleting yourself too quickly, which can lead to stress, poor decision-making, and fatigue.</li>
                <li><strong>If energy reaches zero,</strong> you risk burnout and a drop in performance across all areas.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How Energy Works:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Negative habits</strong> (overworking, skipping meals, sacrificing sleep) reduce energy quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Positive habits</strong> (rest, breaks, exercise, maintaining relationships) restore energy and prevent burnout.</li>
                <li>The challenge is to <strong>manage energy wisely</strong> while balancing Business, Self-Care, and Relationships.</li>
            </ul>
