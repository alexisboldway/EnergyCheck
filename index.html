            <p>Welcome to the High-Achiever Balance Challenge! As a busy entrepreneur or high-performer, you constantly juggle Business, Self-Care, and Relationships. This exercise will test how well you balance these aspects through real-world scenarios.</p>
            <p>You'll start with 24 hours, 100 energy points, and equal scores in business, self-care, and relationships. Each decision will shape your final outcome.</p>

            <h2>Congratulations! You've Completed the Challenge!</h2>
            <p>Finding the right balance between <strong>Business, Self-Care, and Relationships</strong> is an ongoing journey. Your final scores provide insight into how you naturally prioritize these areas—helping you reflect on what’s working and where adjustments may be needed.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Takeaways & Practical Strategies:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Did work take over?</strong> If your Business Score is high but your Self-Care or Relationships suffered, it may be time to set firmer boundaries. Try using time-blocking to dedicate specific hours for deep work, self-care, and personal connections.</li>
                <li><strong>Are you running on empty?</strong> If your Energy Score dropped significantly, consider prioritizing recovery habits like quality sleep, short breaks during work, and intentional downtime. Research shows that strategic rest improves focus, productivity, and long-term success.</li>
                <li><strong>Did your relationships thrive?</strong> If not, schedule non-negotiable personal time just as you would an important business meeting. Strong relationships fuel resilience, reduce stress, and enhance decision-making.</li>
                <li><strong>How effectively are you managing time?</strong> Many high achievers fall into the "always busy" trap instead of focusing on the highest-impact activities. Review your commitments and ask: Does this align with my goals and values? If not, it may be time to delegate or eliminate it.</li>
                <li><strong>Are you building a sustainable system?</strong> True success isn’t about short-term wins—it’s about creating habits that sustain performance without burnout. Identify one small habit change you can commit to this week that will improve your balance.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Success isn’t just about doing more—it’s about doing what matters.</strong> When you align your <strong>business goals, personal well-being, and meaningful connections</strong>, you build a foundation for lasting fulfillment.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Now, reflect:</strong> What will you start doing differently today?</p>
